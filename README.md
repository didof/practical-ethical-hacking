# Practical Ethical Hacking: A Collection of Hands-On Demos

[üáÆüáπ](/docs/ita.md)

Welcome to the **Practical Ethical Hacking** repository\! This project is founded on the belief that the best way to learn how to build secure applications is to understand how they can be broken. This is a curated collection of runnable, hands-on demonstrations of common (and not-so-common) cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Each demo is a self-contained project designed to be run locally, allowing you to play the role of an attacker in a safe and controlled environment. Our goal is not just to show that a vulnerability exists, but to provide a step-by-step narrative that reveals how it can be exploited and, most importantly, how to prevent it.

## üöÄ Available Demos

This collection is actively growing. Here are the currently available demonstrations:

| Demo                                                       | Description                                                                                             | Status     |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------- |
| `host-header-injection`                                    | A full account takeover scenario demonstrating how trusting the `Host` header can be exploited.           | ‚úÖ Runnable |
| `length-extension-attack-with-prevention`                  | A cryptographic attack showing how a naive MAC signature using `SHA256(key + data)` can be forged.        | ‚úÖ Runnable |

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Every demo in this repository is designed to be run independently. The general workflow is simple:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/didof/practical-ethical-hacking.git
    cd practical-ethical-hacking
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a Demo**:
    Choose a vulnerability you want to explore and `cd` into its directory.

    ```bash
    # Example for the Host Header Injection demo
    cd host-header-injection
    ```

3.  **Follow the Local README**:
    Each demo directory contains its own `README.md` file with detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to set up the environment, run the simulation, and understand the attack flow.

## üî¨ Demos Overview

Here's a little more about each scenario.

### üõ°Ô∏è Host Header Injection

  * **Vulnerability**: A web application constructs URLs for critical functions (like password resets) using the user-controllable `Host` header from the HTTP request.
  * **Impact**: This demo walks you through a full account takeover. You will trick the server into generating a password reset link that points to a server you control, allowing you to intercept the secret reset token and change the victim's password.

### ‚õìÔ∏è Length Extension Attack (SHA256)

  * **Vulnerability**: A cryptographic flaw in systems that create message authentication codes (MACs) by simply hashing a secret key concatenated with data (`SHA256(secret + message)`).
  * **Impact**: This demo shows how an attacker, without knowing the secret key, can take an existing valid signature and message, append their own malicious data, and forge a new valid signature for the combined message. This breaks the integrity of the authenticated data. The demo also includes a secure implementation using HMAC for comparison.
